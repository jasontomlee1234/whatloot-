          <h3>Why is Fantom Loot special?</h3>
          <p>
            Fantom Loot is uniqueâ€”the first project of its kind on Fantom. With no company, art,
            team, or attributes, Fantom Loot makes it impossible to gate-keep any
            creative decisions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fantom Loot is the unfiltered, uncensorable building block for stories,
            experiences, games, and more, in the hands of the community, at no
            cost. Loot pursues complete decentralization from day one.

            Yes, you are free to use Fantom Loot in any way you want. For inspiration,

          <h3>How do I value Fantom Loot bags?</h3>
          <p>
            They say that value is always in the eye of the beholder. Fantom Loot is no
            different, with no explicit rarities specified at launch. How you
            value a loot bag is up to you.
          </p>
          <p>
            Still, the community has begun to devise many mechanisms by which to
            assess the rarity of bags and their items. Some of these include{" "}
